    Instructions
</h2>
<!--<p>
In this experiment, you will read some sentences containing metaphors. Please read the sentences carefully and try to understand their meaning, but please read the sentences only once.
</p>
<p>
You can press the <strong>spacebar</strong> to proceed to the next sentence.
</p>
<p>
After reading the sentences, you will see a string of letters.
</p>
<p>
Your task is to decide whether or not the letters form a word in the English language as quickly and accurately as possible.
</p>-->
  With response efficiency in mind, we would like for you to keep each of your index
fingers poised above those two keys (the F and the J on an QWERTY keyboard)
and with your thumbs poised above the spacebar. You will need to hit the spacebar
(with whichever thumb) to move on to the next trial. Here is a picture of the way we
would like for you to keep your hands poised as you go through the task. It is very
important to maintain this position throughout.
